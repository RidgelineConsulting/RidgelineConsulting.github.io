                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I've spent 13 years in defense contracting. Estimating, project management, and operations for companies that build things the Navy depends on. In that world, the job isn't reading the spec. It's reading the room. Figuring out what's actually going on behind what someone wrote down or what they told you in a meeting.</p>

                    <p>That's what I do now for small and mid-size companies. I walk in, ask questions until I find the real problem, not the symptom someone called me about, and build the fix. Sometimes that's a workforce structure that doesn't exist yet. Sometimes it's a lead generation system that runs while you sleep. Sometimes it's just showing you that the process you've been routing around for five years can be replaced in a week.</p>

                    <p>I use AI heavily in how I deliver. It lets me move at a speed and price point that a traditional consulting firm can't touch. But the tool isn't the point. The point is knowing which questions to ask and which silence in the room to pay attention to.</p>

                    <p>Based in Wabash, Indiana. Most owners I talk to assumed fixing the problem would cost more than living with it. They were wrong.</p>

                    <p>By the time we sit down to talk about what's broken, I've already done the homework. Your market, your competitors, your structure. The first conversation isn't me asking what your company does. It's me asking why specific things don't work.</p>

                    <p>I ask questions until the real problem surfaces. Not the symptom you called about. The root cause underneath it. I benchmark what's working, what's broken, and what's missing entirely.</p>

                    <p>You walk away with something real. Not a recommendation deck. A deliverable your team can put to work. Sometimes that's a finished system. Sometimes it's the blueprint and the plan to get there. Either way, it has owners, timelines, and clear criteria for what 'done' looks like.</p>
