                <div class="about-text reveal">
                    <p>I've spent 13 years in defense contracting. Estimating, project management, and operations for companies that build things the Navy depends on. In that world, the job isn't reading the spec. It's reading the room. Figuring out what's actually going on behind what someone wrote down or what they told you in a meeting.</p>

                    <p>That's what I do now for small and mid-size companies. I walk in, ask questions until I find the real problem, not the symptom someone called me about, and build the fix. Sometimes that's a workforce structure that doesn't exist yet. Sometimes it's a lead generation system that runs while you sleep. Sometimes it's just showing you that the process you've been routing around for five years can be replaced in a week.</p>

                    <p>I deliver at a speed and price point that a traditional consulting firm can't touch. Not because the work is lower quality, but because I've built my delivery around tools and systems that compress weeks of work into days. You get consulting-grade output without the consulting-grade invoice.</p>

                    <p>Based in Wabash, Indiana. Working with companies across northern Indiana who know something needs to change but aren't sure where to start.</p>

                                <p>You get working systems, not a binder of recommendations. Tools and frameworks your team uses on day one.</p>

            <p class="section-intro reveal">Most consultants take the client's stated problem at face value and start building a solution for the symptom. I don't work that way.</p>

            <div class="about-grid">
                <div class="about-text reveal">
                    <p>Before I build anything, I need to understand what's actually happening. Not what someone told me in the first meeting. Not what the job posting says. Not the version that sounds clean enough for a boardroom. The real version.</p>

                    <p>I research the company before we ever talk. I ask where it hurts. I identify who owns the problem, not just who reported it. I watch for the things people don't say out loud. Then I benchmark what's working, what's broken, and what's missing entirely.</p>

                    <p>Only after that diagnosis is done do I start building. And when I build, it's for production use. Real tools, real frameworks, real systems that your team picks up and runs with on Monday morning.</p>

                    <p>Thirteen years in defense contracting taught me to read the gap between what the spec says and what's actually true. That's the skill I bring to every engagement.</p>
