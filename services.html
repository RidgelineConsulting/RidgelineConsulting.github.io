                    <h2>Workforce Architecture &amp; Career Frameworks</h2>
                    <p>Your people don't see a future at your company. Not because there isn't one, but because you've never defined it. A senior specialist and a first-year hire carry the same title. There's no progression, no structure, and no way for anyone to know where they stand or where they're headed.</p>
                    <p>That's how you lose your best foreman to the shop down the road offering a title and a raise you would've matched if you'd seen it coming.</p>
                    <p>I build the career infrastructure from the ground up. Labor categories, title progressions, job descriptions written for your actual operation, compensation modeling that lets you roll it out without blowing up your payroll. Your team gets clarity. You get visibility into your workforce and a defensible structure that holds up when you need it to.</p>
                    <p>Everything I build is ready for your team to use on day one. Not a binder. Not a set of slides. Working frameworks with real titles, real expectations, and real progression paths that keep your people where they belong.</p>

    <!-- LEAD GENERATION -->

                    <div class="service-badge">Core Service</div>
                    <h2>Targeted Lead Generation</h2>
                    <p>You know your business needs more work in the pipeline. But you don't have a BD person, and you don't have time to do it yourself. So the pipeline stays thin and growth depends on whoever happens to call.</p>
                    <p>I build a targeted lead generation system that runs in the background while you focus on the work in front of you. Every week, you get a report with qualified prospects, contact information, and enough context to start a real conversation. You tell me what's working and what's not, and the targeting gets sharper over time.</p>
                    <p>Think of it as a business development function without the full-time salary. The reports I deliver would take a junior BD analyst days to compile. I produce them in under an hour. That speed advantage means you get a service that would normally require a dedicated hire, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
