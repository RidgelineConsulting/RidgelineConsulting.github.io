                    <h2>Diagnosis before prescription.</h2>
                    <p>Most consulting firms show up with a solution looking for a problem. We start with the problem. The real one, not the symptom you called about.</p>
                    <p>We research your company, talk to the people doing the work, trace what's broken back to the root cause, and map the gap between where you are and where you need to be. That diagnostic shapes everything that comes next.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes the fix takes a week. Sometimes it's a 90-day build. Sometimes it's ongoing support. But it always starts with understanding what's actually going on before we touch anything.</p>

                    <p>Your people don't see a future at your company. Not because there isn't one, but because you've never defined it. A senior specialist and a first-year hire carry the same title. There's no progression, no structure, and no way for anyone to know where they stand or where they're headed.</p>
                    <p>That's how you lose your best foreman to the shop down the road offering a title and a raise you would've matched if you'd seen it coming.</p>
                    <p>We build the career infrastructure from the ground up. Labor categories, title progressions, job descriptions written for your actual operation, compensation frameworks that make sense, and a retention structure that gives people a reason to stay.</p>

                    <p>Your estimates are inconsistent. They depend on whoever happens to run the numbers. When bids come in wrong, nobody can explain the variance because there's no standardized method, no historical tracking, and no review process.</p>
                    <p>Everyone knows the system is broken. Nobody fixes it because fixing it means slowing down, and slowing down means you're not bidding, not winning, not producing. So the broken process stays and people work around it.</p>
                    <p>We build estimation systems that improve accuracy without grinding your operation to a halt. Standardized methodology, templates, historical data integration, variance tracking, and review cadences that layer into your existing workflow instead of replacing it.</p>
